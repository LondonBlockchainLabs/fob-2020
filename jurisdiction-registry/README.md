# Jurisdiction Registry


## Development Plan

### MVP

Contracts to enable countries to register geometries representing restricted areas.

 - Arweave permaweb (with IPFS address?)
 - Written to smart contract
    - Node cloud program fetches Arweave or IPFS addresses from contract, then loads GeoJSON.

#### Deployments:


| Exclusion Zone | Arweave URL | IPFS URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| London | https://arweave.net/0KCazCF6ok3x37C9TThXCUpnq5jpYD7h-YYFUOcBHmw | https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdG9DLEP9ha9qHZYR7v8dYwFD9PkKSACoZZyZ6J52r6pr |
| Berlin | https://arweave.net/WHYZxyw_AL--zROiJlF_oMf2AQytiMgo5j3tTL-9JPU | https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbsryEzoZhTK3GLJSz2Rp6BrNeLhs69XUEu1auvaFQv1Y |
| Paris | https://arweave.net/EGbLOMIsqGNQ9BM_sHskfKWYVuqESM8tVwcoHx65Z1c | https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcGJotvEs25KFLyxe6Y2jiXZUBaYsqJZbDPWxYpdeJqND |








### v2.0

Front end interfaces enabling government representatives to upload and administer jurisdictional boundaries.

- Update boundary polygons
- Update policies enforced on trusted sensors detected within boundaries.
    - Tax rates
    - Temporal restrictions - penalties applied based on time of day



## Research / Background

[London](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/congestion-charge-zone)

[Berlin](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-environmental-zone): Since 01/01/2008, Berlinâ€™s city centre has had a designated environmental zone in which only vehicles that meet certain emission standards are allowed be driven. Vehicles that are used in the environmental zone must have a **sticker** that identifies its pollutant group. (Geojson generated by hand based on [this map](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/luftqualitaet/umweltzone/download/Umweltzone_Beikarten_1-10_druck.pdf))

Paris. There is [supposedly](https://blog.greenflag.com/2017/drivers-travelling-to-france-require-an-emissions-sticker-to-enter-paris-lyon-or-grenoble/) a congestion zone but couldn't find any maps or geometries. Made this one up just for demo purposes.
